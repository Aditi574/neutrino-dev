You can use Neutrino within your project, preferably using\nscripts defined in your project's package.json.\nSetup\nAfter completing the installation of Neutrino and your Neutrino preset, you will\nwant to define some scripts in your project's package.json in order to simply build your project.\nIn a typical project:\n\nscripts.start would be the command you wish to run during development\nscripts.build would be the command you wish to run to create a production bundle\nscripts.test would be the command you wish to run to execute tests\n\nUsing these script targets may not be suitable for every project; know that they are just\ntypical recommendations for script target names, you may choose a different name if desired\nfor your project.\nBuilding for development\nNeutrino provides the command neutrino start for creating a bundle during development. Using\nneutrino start sets the Node.js environment to development using the NODE_ENV environment variable,\nwhich is available in your project source code. Depending on the presets you are using, neutrino start\nmay also spin up a development server with hot module reloading capabilities.\nCheck the documentation of your preset for details.\nUsage:\n# PRESET_MODULE is the name of the preset to build with, e.g. neutrino-preset-react\nneutrino start --presets PRESET_MODULE\n\nPutting this into your package.json will allow you to build your project using either\nyarn start or npm start.

See\nCustom Configuration for detailed instructions.\nSource Code\nBy default Neutrino presets expect all project source code to live in a directory named src in the\nroot of the project. This includes JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and any other assets\nthat would be available to your compiled project.\nWhen running your project or creating a build bundle, a preset will look for this src directory for\nthe entry point(s) to your application and use this as the relative location for finding other assets\nnecessary for creating your builds.\nBuild Assets\nWhen creating a build bundle, a preset will put the compiled assets, including any generated\nJavaScript files, into a directory named build by default. Typically your Neutrino preset will copy\nany non-JavaScript files from the source directory over to the build directory, allowing you to maintain\nthe same relative path structure for static assets as is used for the source files.\nNormally most projects will exclude checking in this build directory to source control.\nBe sure to add this directory to your project's .gitignore, .hgignore, or similar file.\nTesting\nNeutrino presets by default expect all tests to be located in a directory named test. In order to make the\nseparation between tests and test fixtures or harnesses easier to differentiate, Neutrino presets also\nusually look for test files ending in _test.js or .test.js.

You can even create your own presets from scratch.\nIf you are familiar with Babel presets, Neutrino presets work similarly. For example,\ngiven the Babel preset babel-preset-react, you can compile React code with JSX\nto vanilla JavaScript calls. Neutrino adopts this same concept by adapting Webpack into\na tool that understands configurations-as-packages, i.e. presets. Many more aspects of\ndevelopment surround building a complete React project, for which Webpack is commonly used.\nBy encapsulating the common needs of a project type into a preset, Neutrino allows you to\navoid the upfront cost of configuring and instead focus on project development.\nNot every project is the same, and oftentimes small tweaks need to be made to the build\nconfiguration in order to meet this need. Fortunately Neutrino presets can be modified and\nextended directly from the project you are building. No need to be locked in to a particular\npattern, and no escape hatches that force you into maintaining the entire configuration should\nyou need to make changes.\nPresets can be easily distributing by publishing them to npm or GitHub and installing them\nin your project. This also allows others to discover and build projects based on your own\npresets.\nWhy not a boilerplate or alternative?\nBoilerplates are great resources for scaffolding out application-specific code which\nwould be difficult or tedious to generate for every project. Unfortunately many projects\nalso bake in build configuration into this process, causing a lot of duplication. If you\nneed to make a change to your build steps, you are forced to make that change across all\nyour similar projects. Using a preset rather than a boilerplate keeps this process DRY.\nTools like Create React App have\nbeen fantastic improvements to the tooling ecosystem, but unfortunately only works on specific\nenvironments like React, and do not allow simple extensibility of the build configuration. To\nanswer this new and similar projects are cropping up to build different types of projects,\noften duplicating efforts which miss out on the best practices to share with the other project\ntypes.\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-web/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-web/","title":"Web Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-react/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-react/","title":"React Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-node/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-node/","title":"Node.js Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\nImportant Note: At the time of writing, Neutrino's Node preset does not support watch\ncompilation with neutrino start; it will instead fall back to running a build with the NODE_ENV\nenvironment variable set to development.\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-karma/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-karma/","title":"Karma Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-mocha/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-mocha/","title":"Mocha Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-jest/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-jest/","title":"Jest Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\n"},"presets/neutrino-preset-base/":{"url":"presets/neutrino-preset-base/","title":"Base Preset","keywords":"","body":"heading\n"},"customization/":{"url":"customization/","title":"Customization","keywords":"","body":"Neutrino Customization\nNo two JavaScript projects are ever the same, and as such there may be times when you will need to make modifications\nto the way your Neutrino preset is building your project.

If you need more customization than can be afforded by\naugmenting your project's package.json, consider using this advanced configuration guide to modify your build as\nneeded.\nCreating a project-specific preset\nNeutrino configurations are backed by webpack-chain, a library for\nmaking modifications to a Webpack configuration using a fluent or chained API. When your project needs more advanced\nbuild overrides, you will be interacting with this API in order to perform modifications.\nFirst, we need to create a project-specific preset to make these changes. This can either be a JS file or a directory\nwith an index.js file. Since Neutrino uses Node.js and Webpack for interacting with presets, it is helpful to\nunderstand that this is a Node.js module. By exporting a function from your module, you will be provided with a Neutrino\ninstance for modifying the build. Let's create a file called neutrino-custom.js in the root of our example project:\n// neutrino-custom.js\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  // ...\n};\n\nAt the moment our custom configurator isn't doing anything, but it does get us far enough to be able to tell Neutrino\nto use it for additional configuration. Modify your package.json and add neutrino-custom.js as an additional preset.\nNote: Neutrino will attempt to load this module relative to the current working directory, which should be the root of\nyour project.\n{\n  \"config\": {\n    \"presets\": [\n      \"neutrino-preset-react\",\n      \"neutrino-preset-karma\",\n      \"neutrino-custom.js\"\n    ]  \n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"neutrino build\"\n  }\n}\n\nOther than actually changing the config, that is all the setup necessary for Neutrino to pick up your custom changes.\nConfiguring\nThe Neutrino instance provided to your custom configurator has a config property that is an instance of\nwebpack-chain. We won't go in-depth of all the configuration\npossibilities here, but encourage you to check out the documentation for webpack-chain for instruction on your\nparticular use case.\nThis neutrino.config is an accumulation of all configuration set up to this moment. Every Neutrino preset interacts\nwith and makes changes through this config, which is all available to you. For example, if you are using the presets\nneutrino-preset-react and neutrino-preset-karma, any options set can be extended, manipulated, or removed.\nExample: Neutrino's React preset adds .jsx as a module extension. Let's remove it.\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.config.resolve.extensions.delete('.jsx');\n};\n\nExample: Neutrino's Node.js preset uses babel-preset-env to support Node.js v6.9. Let's change it to support back to\nv4.2. This preset has a rule named \"compile\" and a loader named \"babel\".\nmodule.exports = neutrino => {\n  neutrino.config.module\n    .rule('compile')\n      .loader('babel', ({ options }) => {\n        options.presets[0][1].targets.node = 4.2;\n\n        return { options };\n      });\n};\n\nPresets can also have their own custom data in addition to the Neutrino config.

Each preset will attempt to be loaded from the current working directory's\nnode_modules, nested within, by name, or relative file path. If it cannot be found, an exception will be thrown.\nIn addition to any provided presets, Neutrino will also attempt to load configuration data from the package.json\nresiding in the current working directory. If this package.json contains an object at config.neutrino, this data\nwill be merged.\n.config\nWhen constructing a Neutrino instance, a property of .config is set to be a new instance of\nwebpack-chain. This property is then available to all presets, which\nsubsequently augment it with their specific options. Every preset added uses this single .config to store their data,\nmeaning that preset load order has an effect on which config values take precedence.

Prior to starting this process, Neutrino will trigger and wait for prestart events to\nfinish. After it is complete, Neutrino will trigger and wait for start events to finish.\nIf the Neutrino config contains options for devServer, then a webpack-dev-server will be started. If it is\nconfigured for Node.js, then a build will be created, otherwise a Webpack source watcher will be started.\nCurrently any args passed to start() have no effect and will be passed through to any event handlers.\nThe start method will return a Promise which resolves after the build is done or development watcher has stopped,\nand all start events have finished.\napi\n  .start()\n  .then(() => console.log('Exiting!'));\n\nbuild(args)\nThe build() method is responsible for creating a bundle typically used for production. Prior to starting this process,\nNeutrino will trigger and wait for prebuild events to finish. After it is complete, Neutrino will trigger and wait for\nbuild events to finish.\nCurrently any args passed to build() have no effect and will be passed through to any event handlers.\nThe build method will return a Promise which resolves after the build is done and all build events have finished, or\nwill reject if there was a failure during building.\napi\n  .build()\n  .then(() => console.log('Saved to build/'))\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\n\ntest(args)\nThe test() method is responsible for gathering args needed for testing and triggering relevant events as a signal to\ntest presets that they may run. Using the test method does nothing other than triggering these events; without a\npreset listening for these events, nothing will happen. Prior to starting this process, Neutrino will trigger and wait\nfor pretest events to finish. After it is complete, Neutrino will trigger and wait for\ntest events to finish, in which test runners will do their work.\nAny args passed to test() are passed on to the event handles and typically have properties for an array of\nfiles to test, as well as a property for watching and rerunning tests.\nThe test method will return a Promise which resolves after all test events have finished, or\nwill reject if there was a failure during testing.\napi\n  .test()\n  .then(() => console.log('all passed'))\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\n\napi\n  .test({\n    files: [/* ... */],\n    watch: true\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log('all passed'));\n\ngetWebpackOptions()\nWhile tools like webpack-chain provide a convenient API for creating Webpack configurations, this is not a format that\nis understandable by Webpack. With getWebpackOptions(), the webpack-chain instance at .config will be converted to\nan options object readable directly by Webpack. This call is cached, so subsequent calls to getWebpackOptions will\nresult in the config being rendered only once, but the cached value returned afterwards.\napi.getWebpackOptions(); // -> { ... }\n\nemitForAll(eventName, payload)\nTrigger a Promise-dependent event. For example, calling emitForAll('build') will trigger an event named build, and\neach event handler can return a Promise denoting when it is finished. When all events have finished, this call will\nresolve.\nThis method returns a Promise which resolves when all event handlers have also resolved.\napi\n  .emitForAll('custom-event')\n  .then(() => console.log('All custom-events have resolved!'));\n\nhandleErrors(err, stats)\nThis method is used primarily internally to create a consistent console output when errors occur in the build.

It is important to note that when combined with the --presets parameter, you should use two\ndashes after the last preset to denote the end of the presets and the beginning of the test files.\n❯ neutrino test a_test.js b_test.js\n\n❯ neutrino test --presets neutrino-preset-react neutrino-preset-karma -- a_test.js b_test.js\n\nYou can also pass a flag --watch to watch source files for changes and re-run tests, if your preset supports it.\n❯ neutrino test --watch\n\nExit codes\nWhen the CLI creates an instance of Neutrino, it waits for all commands to either resolve or reject their Promise.\nIf the command succeeded, the CLI will exit with code 0. If there was an error, the CLI will log the error\nto the console and exit with code 1. This makes it easier to use Neutrino commands for status reasons, such\nas failing a pull request on continuous integration if any tests fail or if there are linter errors.\n"},"contributing/":{"url":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nSo, you want to contribute to Neutrino?\nThank you for wanting to help out with Neutrino! We are very happy that you want to contribute and have put together\nthis guide to help you get started. We want to do our best to help you make successful contribution and be part of our\nteam.\nParticipation Conduct\nIn order to ensure everyone has a fair, pleasant, and inclusive experience contributing to Neutrino, we ask that you\nabide by our community participation guidelines, based on the\nContributor Covenant. Please read and understand it for everyone's benefit.\nFollowing these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing\nand developing Neutrino. In return, we will show you respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes,\nand helping you finalize your pull requests.\nWhat we need\nThere is always room for improvement and expansion in Neutrino. Some things that could always help:\n\nTriaging and fixing bugs\nAdding tests to Neutrino which can help ensure it functions properly with new contributions\nKeeping core presets up to date with the best Webpack and Babel options\nExpanding documentation, writing tutorials, and creating example projects\nSomething else, of course!\n\nWhat we probably don't need\nWhile we are happy to review any contribution, there are some things that are best left as an external project:\n\nAdditional presets. While neutrino-dev does contain a number of core presets, we created and maintain these because\nthey were core to most of the projects we personally work on. If there are more presets you believe should be maintained\nby the core, then feel free to raise an issue and we can discuss! Most likely though, additional presets can be\nexternally maintained and published to npm. It still has the same reach potential as bringing it into the core, without\nraising the maintenance burden for Neutrino unnecessarily.\nScaffolding and boilerplates. The goal of Neutrino is to remove over-reliance on boilerplates, instead opting to\npush users into consuming presets. Neutrino itself will not add commands to scaffold out new projects or create\nboilerplate repositories. We do keep a collection of examples-as-documentation for getting started with Neutrino\npresets, but do not wish to govern project structure more than necessary. These types of projects can be maintained\nexternally.\n\nSupport\nNeutrino team members and contributors are here to help you! Should you need assistance or have questions in using\nNeutrino or its core presets, please consider asking on Stack Overflow or other channel rather than filing issues. We\nwould prefer to keep our GitHub issues clear for bugs, feature requests, discussions, and relevant information related\nto its development.\nGuidelines\n\nPlease make a good-faith effort to ensure that code that goes into neutrino-dev follows the existing patterns and\nquality that is already present in the repository.\nCreate issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get\ncommunity feedback.\nStrive for code to be readable. Prefer following functional programming paradigms over object-oriented ones where\npossible.\nKeep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.\n\nGetting started\nMost contributions will involve working with the neutrino-dev codebase. Please refer to the development\ndocumentation for technical details on getting started.\nFiling bugs and issues\nWhen filing an issue, try to answer these questions:\n\nWhat version of Neutrino are you using?\nAre you trying to use any presets? If so, which ones, and what versions?\nAre you using the Yarn client or the npm client? What version?\nWhat version of Node.js are you using?\nWhat operating system are you using?\nWhat did you do?\nWhat did you expect to happen?\nWhat actually happened, contrary to your expectations?\n\nFeature Requests or Enhancements\nPlease file an issue describing your request in detail:\n\nWhat is the goal of the change?\nWhat are the pros and cons of the change?\nCould this dramatically improve the experience of our users?\n\nPlease be open to discussion, and we will respect your time by fairly evaluating your request. In the event that your\nrequest is deemed to not be acceptable to move forward, please understand that isn't a criticism of you as a person,\nbut rather that the idea in its present form may not be right at this time. We respect you and your ideas, and will\nalways encourage contributors to continue to make proposals.\nCode review process\nCode is reviewed by Neutrino team members for quality, conformance to existing patterns, and functionality.\n"},"contributing/code-of-conduct.html":{"url":"contributing/code-of-conduct.html","title":"Code of Conduct","keywords":"","body":"Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct\nOur Pledge\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as\ncontributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and\nour community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,\nnationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and\norientation.\nOur Standards\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\nFocusing on what is best for the community\nShowing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\nThe use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or\nadvances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic\naddress, without explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\nprofessional setting\n\nOur Responsibilities\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable\nbehavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\nreject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions\nthat are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or\npermanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,\nthreatening, offensive, or harmful.\nScope\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community.

The code is broken up into a couple different sections:\npackages and documentation.\nNote: In this guide, commands executable from the command line are prepended with ❯. Lines not starting\nwith this symbol show sample console output from running the previous command.\nGetting started\nThe first step to start developing neutrino-dev is forking the repository to your own GitHub account.\nFork mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev on GitHub\nOnce that is done, you can clone your copy of the repository on your computer, replacing USER with the username\nof the account you forked the repository to:\n❯ git clone git@github.com:USER/neutrino-dev.git\n❯ cd neutrino-dev\n\nMaking changes\nWhen you make changes to neutrino-dev, you should make them in a branch separate from master. Start from the\nmaster branch and create a new branch for your changes.\nExample: You want to create a core preset for JavaScript Standard Style. You need a new branch for this work.\n❯ git checkout -b standard-style\nSwitched to a new branch 'standard-style'\n\nWhile making changes, be sure to test your code out for expected operation. If possible or applicable, write a\ntest that can verify these changes in the future.\nSubmitting a pull request\nOnce you are satisified with your changes, you should commit them and submit a pull request. Use git add\nin order to add files that should be commited. Give your changes a descriptive but not overly verbose message.\n❯ git add .\n❯ git commit -m \"Feature: Adding new core preset for JavaScript Standard Style\"\n❯ git push origin standard-style\n\nNow if you open the GitHub page for your repository, GitHub should display a button to open a pull request for\nthe branch and commit you just pushed. When filling out the details of the pull request, try to be as descriptive\nas possible, following our detailed contribution guidelines.\nReceiving updates\nIf you need to update your local copy of neutrino-dev to be in sync with the main neutrino-dev repository, you\nwill want to fetch upstream changes. Add the main neutrino-dev repo as an upstream to your local copy, then fetch\nthe latest changes from the master branch.\n❯ git checkout master\n❯ git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/neutrino-dev.git\n❯ git pull upstream master\n\nCongrats!\nYou just made a contribution to Neutrino! We are so happy to have your help! :tada:\n"}}}
